# User Creation Script â€“ Bash Automation

## Purpose

This script is designed to **interactively create a Linux user** with customizable options such as:
- Custom or default home directory
- Preferred login shell
- Group membership (existing or newly created)

It helps streamline user provisioning with basic input validation and safety checks.

---

## Features

- Ensures the script is executed with root privileges
- Prompts for a unique username and checks against `/etc/passwd`
- Offers optional custom home directory
- Presents a menu to choose a login shell
- Supports assigning the user to an existing or newly created group
- Combines all parameters into a single `useradd` operation
